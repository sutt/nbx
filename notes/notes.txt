CellPullRequest:

	
Overview / Main Points
------------------------

	
	- need a way to merge only certain cells, otherwise all the progress is overwritten
	
		- unless, we can create a merge strategy which does UNION on exisiting work and new additions
		
	- idea: create a "cool" guid in the cell where you want to receive the teachers-pr. This can be function in CPR-module. Once you have that unique string, in the notebook, merge can navigate and find it. e.g.:
	
		---------------
		In[ ] cpr.public_code(2)
		---------------
		Out[ ] awesome-aardvark-2345
		----------------
		In [ ] 
		----------------
		
			-> now we'll try to merge just below awesome-aardvark-2345 on the students notebook
			
	- Stages of Dev:
		1.) teacher able to push out code to students
		2.) students are able to deliver teacher their code
		
		- nice to haves:
			- most projects will involve a datasets so that will need to be included in the 
			- each student can have one main repo where teacher can sync with students progress
			
		- other things to consider:
			- need to .gitignore large datasets, and ipynb_checkpoints, otherwise it will be a nightmare merge
			- just add/commit the notebook in progress
			
	Marketing Thoughts:
	
		nbx - notebook exchange
		
		to globals: "no more scrolling down"
		
		to locals: pair programming without the clunkiness of working on someone's computer.
		
			- we'll create a wheel that will match people
		
		marketing material: a repo ready to go where you can "play with someone" e.g. it will have some leetcode challenges.
		
Todo:
-------------------------

	12.31
	
		"ship ship ship"
		[x] do we need to use ImportClass? -> no
		[x] build js-based scripts for give + receive
		[x] commit it
		
		- major things holding us away from v0.1
			[ ] little details like notebook could be in a dir, find_git_root, etc
			[ ] api specified with options
		 - other important things:
		    [ ] don't search for cell input term, use cell selection index
			[ ] setTimeout's in nbx2.get_answer()
	
	12.29
		[x] get a commit in with new hack
			
			[x] clean up directory
			
			[x] finish up books for now:
				[x] MiscCprJS.ipynb
				[x] JsToPythonScope.ipynb
				
			[~] nb to demo new functionality of no notebok name
			
		[x] next commit
			
			[~] demo in book2: nb_name, both specified and implicit
			
			[x] save functionality included
				- with just a timeout for now?
					-> this won't work because we can't do js first
					
				- ultimate hack: execute neccesary python 
				  from kernel.execute with the sequential-js pattern
				
			
		
		[ ] vscode dev settings:
		
			[ ] no autocomplete for local variables
			
			import problems (have to be fixed with __init__.py)
			https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/3840
			https://github.com/Microsoft/python-language-server/issues/887
			https://github.com/microsoft/python-language-server/issues/1156
			
	
	12.28
	
		[x] finish up on the js->python bug; if it's not resolved invent a hack
		
			[x] try get_ipython() solution
				[x] find the line of code
				-> didn't work
				
			if that doesn't work
			[x] commit problem books
				[x] add links to other people with the problem
				[x] add proposed solutions:
					- onLoad e..g in notebook's call to from nbx import get_answer() just drop it into the kernel then!
					-> doesn't work, globals aren't shared across modules
				
			[x] add a hack solution:
				- by default take the "last" .ipynb file (so no argument)
				- and an argument
				
			[x] are there more spots in the workflow where we need js->python messaging? postSave?
		

	12.26
	
	Thoughts:
		+ blog post - jupyter based dev
	
	[x] can we add student and teacher repos by gitignoring the .git folder?
		-> yes with a little care:
		> add `teacher/teacher-cpr/.git` to .gitignore
		> git add teacher/teacher-cpr/ (good: adds all content sans .git)
		> git add teacher/             (bad: adds as a submodule)
		-> note: we use remote=local for these repos
		[x] add new demonstration of functionality.
	
	[z] very basic git-push and git-pull
		- as check_output call to bash script?
			[x] run a time.time() recorder to see significant lag between
				pre/post git-action
		[x] subprocess calling directory experiments
		
	[x] morning commit: 
		[x] adding gitcomm
		[x] subproc
			[x] add only .cpr
			[x] capture some check_output 
		[x] remove .sh scripts
		[x] demo: teacher: answer-send, student: answer-receive 
		
	[ ] second commit
		[ ] notebook describing gitcomm functionality
			[ ] why doesn't git push print out?
				-> looks like cursor gets active as soon as cmd is run
		[~] send notebook name module
		[ ] some unittests for cmd_adj
			-> need to name files test_* 
			[x] run pytest for python3?
				-> conda activate base (which give python PATH priority)
		[ ] git mv cpr.py -> frontjs.py
			[ ] need to correct all the notebooks using cpr
		
		[x] one function for suproc in push_answer(), pull_answer()
			[x] need to adjust term in give/get _answer
			
		[ ] need a log file, printing to notebook will just get overwritten.
		
		[x] take all three actions to one function:
			cpr.reload_nb(), merge.give_answer(), gitcomm.answer_push()
			-> in nbx?
			
	[x] dev settings
		[x] exclude __pycache__ from vscode explorer
			-> in settings, under "files.exclude"
		[x] intellisense for vscode can't handle dot imports, e.g. .merge
			-> imported chess workspace settings
			-> added a __init__.py to cpr directory
			-> updated vscode extension		
				Id: ms-python.python
				Version: 2019.2.5558
					->
				Version: 2019.3.6558
		
		
	[ ] how to push/pull from particular commit-shas in git?
		-> maybe just separate branches?
	
	[x] get notebook name from js -> python; pass to give_answer, get_answer
		[x] write it out to a file
		
		[x] breakout session:
			[x] new notebook
			[x] print below but within the same input cell
			[x] parsing the globals() as string
			[~] using a class instatiation
			- can just writeout to .cpr/.nbname?
				-> no: no writing untill all "input-code" is run and then "output/kernel.execute" code gets run
			[x] update push_answer() to specify only cells.json
			
			
			-> this is still giving me problems because js doesn't execute untill all python from kernel is finished?
			
			-> note: if an exception occurs while executing the python, 
				the call to display(Javascript(js)) gets cancelled
				
			- closest issue I've found on this:
			https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3187
			
				-also:
				https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/issues/369
				https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3533
				
				- these should work?
				https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/comms.html
				
				- very helpful
				https://github.com/WorldWideTelescope/pywwt/issues/210
				
					- a pattern here works
					https://github.com/kafonek/ipython_blocking
					
				- another guy, same problem:	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30902898/ipython-notebook-javascript-retrieve-content-from-javascript-variables
				
				https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/7804
				
				- maybe this guy solves it?	https://github.com/jdfreder/ipython-jsobject/blob/master/jsobject/utils.py
				
				-> searching github for "javascript display" gives lots of promising leads
				
				-> can also try multiprocessing example	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2846653/how-can-i-use-threading-in-python
					
	
	[ ] still need the async call from save_notebook -> merge.write_answer
		- use a polling loop thread in python waiting
		
	[ ] connect student and teacher to a repo and start demo-ing examples
	
	[ ] git specialty functionality
		[ ] how to only add .cpr directory?
		[ ] how to find root of repo?
		
	[ ] add all functionalities: front-end (reload_nb), controller (merge.py) and model-comm (gitcomm.py) into functions give_answer, get_answer
	
	[ ] notebook trust issues:
		[ ] how do nb's downloaded from git end up?  untrusted?
		[ ] how do you convert trust <-> untrust, simplest way possible?
			-> will need to include this instructions
		[ ] untrusted nbs cant execute display(Javascript()), correct?
		[ ] how to check for trust within the notebook?
		[ ] a git hook to trust the notebook?
		[ ] a shell script run via subprocess to trust the script
	
	misc issues
		[ ] git needs password saved
		[ ] send other files in git push/pull
		[ ] multi-notebook support: when there's tow notebook
		[ ] support for forks:
			-> defaults to origin's url, but has
		[ ] we don't want to trust js in output-section of an answer cell:
			e.g. IPython.kernel.execute('os.rmdir("/");')
		
	cells.json schema
		[ ] multinotebook support
		[ ] ordered answers
	


	12.24
	
	Thoughts:
		+ is git going to be able to merge cells.json well?
			- is there a force --local or force --remote merge option?
			- what kind of situations break merge? when there's multiple
			  of the same cell?
		+ do we have to pull before pushing?
			- only when there's 2-way pushing, correct?
		+ there's two methods of operating: 	
			1-to-many teacher->students
			1-to-1:   student<->student "pair programming"
		
	
	[x] Finish commit of merge.py functionality
		[x] add merge.py
		[x] add .cpr
		[x] delete extra notebooks
		[x] add BasicMerge1.ipynb
			[x] matplotlib example
		[x] add ParseJson1.ipynb
		[x] cleanup directory, assets
			[x] demo.ipynb, demo2.ipynb to own directory
			[x] fix calls in ParseJson1
			[x] js-debug.js -> assets
			

	
	12.23
	
	Thoughts:
		+ we can either:
			- find the selected cell via text parsing
			- pass it's index from js
		
		+ this is an MVC app:
			
			M: is mostly the .ipynb format, also some counter stuff for nbx tracking indexes
			
			V: the "front-end" javascript aspect like load_notebook, goto cell, and the git pull portion
			
			C: save_notebook and the git commit/push portion allows us to write to the model
			
			-> we don't need to sync the models, only apply a insert at each step
			
	
	[x] basecamp: freshen up dev directory
		- remove submodules
			> add folders to .gitingore
			> git rm -r --cached <folder>
		- remove unnec. notebooks
		
	[x] add animate/select functions to demo_function
	
	[x] two notebooks:
		[x] document reload+goto behavior in detail
		[x] document misc js methods
		[x] move misc functionality out of cpr into cpr.misc
		
	
	[ ] templates.js -> how to load into python strings?
		-> perhaps build one big js function with boolean switches for functionality,
		   and simply set the flags for the switches in python

	
	[x] add save function
		[x] verify the async nature, via console -> yes
		[x] simple promise hack with .then() -> no
		[x] replicate pattern for animate -> no, can't do 
		[x] should we use the passed back promise option? -> idk
		[x] catch events in jupyter? 
			-> can't find 'notebook_saved.Notebook' in python api 
				(this is triggered in save_notebook_success)
		[x] download examples and see if someone else uses save_notebook
			-> printview/main.js has this method
		[x] it's hard to verify if save notebook has completed?
			->debugger
			-> yes, verified via 
		
	[ ] advanced save functionality
		[ ] how do we call back to python (in order to run git-merge) once save_notebook within js is completed?
			[ ] demonstrate if display(Javascript()) is blocking in python?
		[ ] what does the boolean argument in save_notebook(bool) do?
			
	[x] next commit:
		[x] implement save functionality in reload_nb()
		[x] update BasicCpr1
		[x] add templates.js
		[x] put some of the js discoveries in misc cpr
	
	[x] demonstrate rewriting notebook using f.write()
		-> need to save notebook before running give_answer() or get_answer()
	
    [ ] log interesting jupyter bug: when we print js to cell output, jupyter exectutes it
		- realod_nb() prints js to the cell's output
		- bug: when IPython.notebook.load_notebook() is called, 
		
		[x] document the call stack which is executing it:
			- load_notebook_success()
				- Notebook.fromJSON(<bomb_cell_number>)
					-CodeCell.fromJSON(data.outputs, ...)
				
				where data,outputs[0].data: {application/javascript: "var mything = ..." ...}
				? where does the application/javascript thing come from? in my output?
					-> no I never print it.
				
				...
				OutputArea.append_mime_type
		
		- does this occur when notebook is first loaded from jupyter dashboard?
		- does this only occur when you've import display.display and Javascript?
		- does this only occur if notebook is "trusted"? 
			-> for me the nb is trusted by default
			-> how to turn trust off?
		- extra malicious: overwrite the js after load, to hide the problem
		
	[ ] prototype the json insert
		[ ] check the sizeof the json, if too large warn...
		
	[ ] temporarily freeze autosave - to prevent simultaeneous writes to .ipynb
	
	[ ] add configuration files for nbx behaviors, e.g. cell flash
		both workspace and user settings
	

	12.18
	
	[x] re-organize notes
	
	[ ] MVP - demo to brianna level, ideally ready for Jenny on Friday afternoon.
	
		misc
		[ ] kernel.execute()
		[ ] cleanup old HelloCpr notebooks
	
		[ ] javascript aspect
			[ ] load_notebook
			[ ] callbacks
			[ ] save_notebook
			[ ] cell.cursor
			[ ] color.animate
			
		[ ] automate some commit-push and commit-pull
		
		[ ] module skeleton
			[ ] teach
			[ ] get_answer
			
	
	+ Brainstorm future features:
	
		important to do's:
		- is python able to parse these jsons well? for example excaping quotes and images, etc?
	
		- need a way to select only certain cells for broadcast
		
		- note you don't actually git commit/push/pull the notebook itself but a secondary representation which allows another module to insert with union-style particular cells
		
		- so...because there's a secondary [partial] representation that doesn't nec. match either the teacher's or student's notebook, we need a way to consolidate and reconcile both versions (even if they end up in a different order) for git commit.
	
	12.17
	
	Thoughts:
	
		The git merge-hook / merge will be a hairy beast to tackle.
		
		It will probably involve liberal overwriting of metadata and using 
			git add --patch 
		to only commit a certain amount of cells (both input and output)

		How to commit before pull, and then push later, at that point you've added a bunch of extraneous cells and meta-data to "receive an answer without overwriting anything", how do you send one back? Maybe by switching branches? Or maybe creating an intermediate representation of the .ipynb strcture?
			-> whatever way, we can concentrate on teacher broadcast mode where commits only move one way.
			
		Ultimately I should concentrate on an MVP where I know the merge will work, and see how well that works before going deeply into the merge portion.
		
		Once we can validate the UX we'll look at how easy it is to break with a live testing exercise.
		
	Sober Thoughts:
	
		Need to do cell-add outside of the full notebook structure. 
		
		An intermediate representation of exchanged cell would be best
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21518381/proper-way-to-wait-for-one-function-to-finish-before-continuing
		

	12.16
	
	[x] get a basic reload, scroll example
		-> via setTimeout()
		
	[ ] explore callbacks, make them work here
	
	[ ] where are static [js] files kept in my python environment?
	
	[x] jquery flash the color?
	
	start looking into git merging and adding patches (only some content from cells)
	
	12.15
	
	[x] put stuff in place for a commit
	
	[x] intellisense for vscode settings
			
	[ ] build an MVP
	
	[ ] build some simple tests like merging conflict example1

	12.15
	
	Thoughts:
	
		One way to get a nice client-side reload after git-pull, is by doing stuff after load_notebook, like reversing the scroll_to_top()
		
		"notebook"/notebook/static/js/scrollmanager.js - has scroll functions
		
		But another way is to write our own extension which mimics the way load_notebook occurs, but changes the bad functionality.

	
	12.14
	
	[x] setup the master git repo for the project
	
	[x] setup the local git-server 
		->resides cpr/remote/main  
		->called remote local in student-cpr and teacher-cpr
		detailed: see notes
			
	
	[ ] setup a testing framework 
	
		[ ] how will we drive changes? maybe just writing the "resultant" json from python instead of using a webdriver on browser to automate jupyter?
	
	[x] setup the module for cpr class
	
	[ ] setup a skeleton for subprocess to git
	
	[ ] investigate libraries for python-git
	
	[ ] create some examples of merge conflicts
	
	[ ] how to do git merge without git-pull?
	
		- for testing processes: we'd operate on files instead repo's; can we go something like that?
	
	[x] try executing window.location.realod() from python
		from IPython.display import Javascript
		Javascript("window.location.reload()")
		
	[ ] copy the pattern in an example nb_ensensions
		
		
	[x] verify the reload command process
	
			[x] compare diffs b/w teacher's book1.ipynb and students' book1.ipynb
				after failed merge
				
				in misc/saved-files as book1-conflicts.ipynb, book1-=good.ipynb
				>git diff --no-index book1-good.ipynb book1-conflicts.ipynb
				
				-> looks like "<<<<<<<<HEAD" is throwing off json
				-> also there was a duplicate 'source' item from teacher writing into cell and student having it blank.
				
	
		[x] find the javascript sources for jupyter
		-> window.location.realod() works to view the newly inserted code, but is clunky and doesn't keep the cursor in position.

			[x] better option for window reloading? -> not at this point
					
				[x] execute those from console
				
		
	
	12.12
	
	[x] set up a dummy remote repo
	[x] open up two terminals, two notebooks, two local repos
	
	[x] understand the delay in RELOAD for notebook
		-> refreshing the page seems to work
	
	[ ] how well do changes to meta-data within a cell work to merge?
		[x] demonstrate some meta-data changing -> need to save from notebook
	
	[x] build a script for add, commit push
	[x] build a script to add, commit, pull
	
	[ ] try a git checkout -- book1.ipynb while live
	
	[x] setup an offline working copy
		
	
	[x] surface some client issues by changing students notebook before the pull
	
	[x] can i run an .sh file in windows terminal?
		->yes, but it shells out and closes too quickly to read
		[x] perhaps it can work for git? -> yes
		
	[x] do i have any extensions installed in base?
		-> a few like conda installed extensions
